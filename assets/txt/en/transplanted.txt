From that landscape I am now missing. I have been transplanted. I have transplanted myself.

I move my body. I move my womb. I move my self. I move my self

I grow my habits. I grow my roots. I grow my rhizomatic self and I grow into you. You grow in me. I grow my home in you.

Intertwined we grow and I grow. I split, you grow. My roots reach deep. I reach an understanding. My roots reach an understanding.

A rhizomatic connection to other roots that further climb to reach other minds and thought - passes instantly.

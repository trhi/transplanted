Suddenly I understand and I am understood. Then I struggle again to make myself understood.

I tire while talking. What an effort to communicate, to pass my message.

No one can grasp my sense of humor, because all my jokes fail in their formulations.

Uprooted I am. I am uprooted. My roots are up. I listen to you. I listen to my home. I listen to me.

My child speaks my language, what a relief, how soothing to speak to her.

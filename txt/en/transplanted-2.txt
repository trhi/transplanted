From that landscape I am now missing.
I have been transplanted.
I have transplanted myself.
I myself have transplanted myself.

My roots remain, at least in part.
But I can no longer grow there, impossible. Now I only grow here.

But somehow, I am still there. You see?

I move my body.
I move my womb.
I move my self.
I move myself.

I grow my habits.
I grow my roots.
I grow my rhizomatic self and I grow into you.
You grow in me.
I grow my home in you.
I grow into you.

Intertwined we grow and I grow.
I split, you grow.
My roots reach deep.
I reach an understanding.
My roots reach an understanding.
Finally, I understand.

A rhizomatic connection to other roots that further climb to reach other minds and thought.
Thought passes instantly.
Communication is thought that passes instantly.

Language is just a medium.
Moving my lips is just a medium, just a dance.
Moving my lips is just a dance.
Moving my body is just a dance.
